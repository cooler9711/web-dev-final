# web dev final website

this is the website for my web dev final. i am completely aware that it scales on other devices *terribly* so, yeah.

i tried to simply recreate my main [website](http://cooler9711.com) as much as i could, but i wanted it to be a bit different so my web dev teacher wouldn't accuse me of just mirroring and replacing some things.
